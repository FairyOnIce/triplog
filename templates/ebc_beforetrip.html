 <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>It has been a big dream for me to visit Nepal since I read a book called
        <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Into-Thin-Air-Personal-Disaster/dp/0385494785">Into thin air</a>
        in my college writing class back when I was an undergraduate student.

        At that time my English was pretty bad and reading through a book was a big challenge.
        But nevertheless, I finished reading this book because the story was shockingly interesting.
        <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Into-Thin-Air-Personal-Disaster/dp/0385494785">Into thin air</a> is
        a real story of mountaineers who risked their lives to reach the summit of the highest mountain on earth
        (and more importantly come back alive).
        It sounds pretty stupid that people pay thousands of dollars for tours that offer only basic life support and
        that could potentially blind you, cripple you or, in the worst case, kill you.

        But I was also fascinated by the idea of climbing up the highest point on earth.
        Someday, I would love to visit or at least see this place that has been fascinating hundreds of strong mountaineers.

    <p>
        About a decade has past since my collage writing class.
        When my husband and I were planning our annual vacation trip last year in 2017,
        I found that although going to the summit of Everest requires serious mountaineering experiences,
        going to the base camp (5,297m, 17,598 ft) is feasible for most adults in good fit during the right seasons.
        The good seasons are March - May and October - November that avoid the monsoon seasons (June - September)
        and whiter (December - February).
        Early May seems to be the most popular season largely because of beautiful alpine flowers.
        Another reason is that this is the time for those climbing the summit to visit EBC.
        So early May is the time when you can see EBC with colourful tents.
        As my husband and I were planning to start a family sometime soon,
        we won't be able to visit EBC for a long time if we do not do this now.
        This motivated us to visit Nepal to see Mt. Everest in May 2018.
    </p>
    <br>

    <p>
        We are not visiting the summit like Jon Krakauer and other brave mountaineers.
        But yet visiting EBC had a lot of challenges for seasonal hikers like us.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am an engineer, living in North America, of course at the sea level, and sitting at desk for more tahn 8 hours every day.
        My daily work has nothing to do with mountaineering.
        I do not speak in Nepalish and the highest mountain that I visited was Mauna Kea (4,207.3m (13,803 ft)) in Hawaii.
        I achieved the summit by car.
        So organizing a trip to above 5,000m elevation in a country on another hemisphere is a non trivial task.
    </p>

        Here are the lists of challenges that I faced:
        <h2>The Challenges</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Getting more than 2 weeks of vacation days during the EBC trekking seasons for both my husband and me</li>
            <li>Physically prepared for high altitude environment</li>
            <li>Gather information and plan the affordable trip</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>+2 weeks vacations</h2>
        <p>
            The time required for EBC treking vary across tours.
            The shortest trip to EBC seems to take about 7 - 8 days, and often has at most 1 acclimitization day.
            This route takes the same route in and out:
            <ol>
            <li>Lukla -> Namche Bazzar -> Tengboche -> Dingboche -> Lobuche -> Everest Base Camp -> Dingboche -> Lukla
            </ol>
            See <a href="https://yumi-trip-backlog.herokuapp.com/ebc">Before trip</a> for the map.

            We did not want to take this route because the schedule seems too tight,
            and we wanted to make sure that we will have enough acclimitization days.
        </p>
        <p>
            Gyoko Lake is a popular "adds-on" to the EBC trek.
            Going to Gyoko lake requires additional 3 days to the route but it can make the entire trek into a loop.
            Visiting EBC is once-in-life-time experience and who knows if we come back to this area on earth in the future?
            So we decided to add Gyoko lake in our routes.
            We also decided to have two acclimitization days and this made our EBC trip to extend 15 days.
            See <a href="https://yumi-trip-backlog.herokuapp.com/ebc">Before trip</a> for the exact map.
        </p>
        <p>
            We overcame this first challenge by planning ahead, and saved vacation days in 2017.
        </p>

        <h2>Physical Preparation for High Altitude</h2>
        <p>
            I was concerened about the high altitude.
            The highest altitude that I visited was 4,207m in Mauna Kea, and
            I felt very weak when I was there.
            You get altitutde sickness especially when you are tired and did not have a good sleep.
            So in order to avoid this, we decdided to have extra buffer days to fix the jet lag in Kathumandu before our 15 trekking days.

        </p>
        <h2>Gather information and plan the affordable trip</h2>
        <p>
            Gathering infomation online was one of the biggest challenge and that is also the reason why I was motivated to log my experience.
            <h3>Tour vs individual trekking</h3>
            We know that individual trekking is possible and potentially cheaper.
            But we decided to go with a tour because we are pretty new to this high altitude world, and wanted to have someone that we can rely on in the case of emergency.
            Nevertheless, <a href="https://www.twowanderingsoles.com/blog/how-much-does-everest-base-camp-trek-cost">this blog</a> gave me a good ideas on individual trek.
            <h3>Western tour vs local tour</h3>
            The price of EBC tour vary between $700 - $5,000, and local tours are in the lower range (< $2,000)
            while the western tours are in higher range (> $2,000).

            My impression of the biggest difference in service was that western tour comes with western tour guide and "nice" tea house accomodation while the local tours come with local guide and "regular" accomodation.

            We decided to go with the local tour because we did not really care much about the nice accomodation.
            <h3>Choosing local tours </h3>
            <a href="https://www.bookmundi.com/everest-base-camp-trek/d5-bm">Bookmundi </a> website was great help deciding on which local tours to select.
            You can chat with the tour organizers on live (for free) to negotiate the price and ask basic questions.

    <blockquote>
        Most electricity along the trek comes from solar power so teahouse charge anywhere from $2 for a full charge to $3 per hour near the top.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        On the ECB trail, a liter of water can cost anywhere from $1 to $3 USD along the way. And when you need to drink 3-5+ liters of water per day to avoid altitude sickness and dehydration, thatâ€™s a lot of money!
